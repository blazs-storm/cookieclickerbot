# Cookie Clicker Full Automation

This is a userscript that fully automates Cookie Clicker, a popular incremental game. It is designed to work with Tampermonkey and Greasemonkey browser extensions.

## Features

- Automatically clicks the big cookie
- Buys upgrades and buildings, prioritizing the cheaper option
- Clicks golden cookies and wrinklers
- Automates seasonal events (like Halloween and Christmas)
- Harvests and plants in the garden (if unlocked)
- Automates ascensions, heavenly chips spending, and dragon training
- Manages sugar lumps automatically

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) on your browser.
2. Click [here](https://github.com/your-username/cookie-clicker-automation/raw/main/cookie-clicker-automation.user.js) to install the script directly from this repository.
3. Open [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) in your browser, and the automation will start automatically.

## How It Works

- The script intelligently purchases upgrades or buildings based on which one is cheaper.
- It also manages garden activities, clicks on golden cookies, handles buffs, and ascends when appropriate.
